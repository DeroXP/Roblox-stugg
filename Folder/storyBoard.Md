# Please.
Drooped off from bus the work open doors clock in turn on generater and radio do tasks for example starting up systems and cleaning stocking helping employees etc.
Player(s) notice something off then boom absolute mind fuck of an effect anims for cams and characters alot of scripting btw and more and more modeling...
# Help.
Teleported to new location and location is very odd should either look like and very long garage then leads into a playplace but very weird also with weird and
intricit designs aswell as puzzle these puzzle should not be easy at all and actually very challenge kinda like a escape room some puzzles to be rng so it isn't
always the same
# Momma.
This one is a very dark underground kinda place the player(s) room around this space it should sort of look like an cave this is where the scary shit starts
happening but no dangers yet only really jumpscares but to beat this just find the exit
# Breath.
This takes place in a hospital looking place with pretty bright white lights player(s) with have to hide from an entity called the source
so basically this is time based sort of how it is like in super mario maker where this is a time frame pretty much the entity goes aound the map in seconds and if a player is not hidden either under a bed or in a locker/closet they immediatly die basically this will only start happening when the player's start the generater. Puzzles for this will include crosswords, pattern to code match(similar to bear where you had to match the colors to the numbers), and a numpad code at the exit door which code is a five key found with a code geotten from the pattern to code match puzzle which gives you an key and this key opens five cabinets player(s) have to look for these cabinets and find the five key thing open the door or maybe and old fashion elevator then boom they escape the s0uÏ€c3 -- might be the in game name.
# Palace
So in this is a screen immediatly popped up say enter Keycode with a hint below say "Should've been paying attention to the names :)" so basically they would have to answer the code as all of the game names before this one being (Please. Help. Momma. Breath.) if they enter that in then they can now enter into the level this level will either be a peace area where players can just look at the secerny of the weird but cool looking place kinda looking like a dreamcore gallery or it will be the player in a old broken down house type of place where they will have an entity proposing themselves as the player(s) mom basically kinda like weird strict dad and granny mom will give tasks and then bed time comes the players have to sneek out of the house without being caught. Side Note: the mom look like the grudge but very tall and lanky.
# Suburbs
only actual backrooms level in the game just basically everything in the backrooms

okay all for now won't be adding more ideas until we get to this point.
