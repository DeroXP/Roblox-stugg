# Please.
The player or players explore what looks to be an old, abandoned store at the start of the game as teenagers. As they poke around, they find some records concerning the establishment that include details about who owns it and why it was closed. They hear sirens and police lights outside while they are going over these documents. After that, the player dashes to the rear door of the staff area, opens it, and tumbles into a sewer.
# Help.
Teleported to a new location, which is very strange; it should resemble a long garage that leads into a strange playground. It should also have very intricate and strange designs, and some of the puzzles should be extremely difficult and challenging—almost like an escape room—with different puzzles that reveal more about the owners' relationship with his mother and other reasons why he gave up his job to pursue his dream.
# Momma.
This one is a very dark underground sort of place where the player(s) will be placed. It should sort of look like a cave here, where the scary stuff starts, but there aren't any dangers yet—just jumpscares. To beat this, find the exit; if there are any paper hints lying around, it would be a kiddy drawing depicting the owner's sad moment as he watches his mom slowly die.
# Breath.
This game is set in a hospital-like setting with bright white lights. The player(s) must hide from an entity known as the source. In essence, this is time-based, similar to Super Mario Maker, where the entity moves across the map in a matter of seconds and kills them instantly if they are not hidden—either under a bed or in a locker or closet. This will only begin to happen when the player(s) starts the generator. Puzzles for this will include crosswords, pattern to code match (think of it as bear where you had to match the colors to the numbers), and a numpad code at the exit door that unlocks five cabinets. The player(s) must search for these cabinets and locate the five key item to open the door, or possibly an old-fashioned elevator, and then they will be able to escape the s0uπc3. When this location is finished, a cutscene with the owner's mother's final remarks will play.
# Palace
This should be a place that resembles paradise for Christians, complete with white and gold classical music. It should also be a place where players may find out the names of many moms and their dates of death, essentially a graveyard or grave site. This is essentially the entire location, and players should keep the mother's name in mind.

okay all for now won't be adding more ideas until we get to this point.
