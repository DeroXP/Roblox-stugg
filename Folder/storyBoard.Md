# Please.
The game begins with the player or players as teenagers exploring what appears to be an old, abandoned store. They look around and discover some documents about the place, including information about its owner and the reasons behind its closure. As they are looking through these documents, police lights and sirens can be heard outside. The player then runs to the staff room's back door, opens it, and falls into a sewer.
# Help.
Teleported to new location and location is very odd should either look like and very long garage then leads into a playplace but very weird also with weird and
intricit designs aswell as puzzle these puzzle should not be easy at all and actually very challenge kinda like a escape room some puzzles to be rng so it isn't
always the same, also some of these puzzle will show some lore pointed towards the owners and his relationship with his mom and more to why he quit working and building
on his dream in the first place.
# Momma.
This one is a very dark underground kinda place the player(s) room around this space it should sort of look like an cave this is where the scary shit starts
happening but no dangers yet only really jumpscares but to beat this just find the exit, hints of the owners mom if there are paper laying around it would be
and kiddy type of drawing showing the depressing moment of the owner watching his mom slowly passing away.
# Breath.
This takes place in a hospital looking place with pretty bright white lights player(s) with have to hide from an entity called the source
so basically this is time based sort of how it is like in super mario maker where this is a time frame pretty much the entity goes aound the map in seconds and if a player is not hidden either under a bed or in a locker/closet they immediatly die basically this will only start happening when the player's start the generater. Puzzles for this will include crosswords, pattern to code match(similar to bear where you had to match the colors to the numbers), and a numpad code at the exit door which code is a five key found with a code geotten from the pattern to code match puzzle which gives you an key and this key opens five cabinets player(s) have to look for these cabinets and find the five key thing open the door or maybe and old fashion elevator then boom they escape the s0uÏ€c3. Once finished with this place it will show an cutscene of an storyline of the owner's moms last words.
# Palace
This should be an place that similarlly represents on how an christian would resemble heaven with like white and gold classical musicand also and place with a lot of names the player's can find out the mothers name and date of death, player's should keep this in mind and this is pretty much the whole place.

okay all for now won't be adding more ideas until we get to this point.
