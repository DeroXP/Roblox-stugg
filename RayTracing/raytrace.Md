# "RayTracing"
ray tracing in roblox is not yet a thing but we can replicated how it works using rays and light and parts

### Explanation

So basically what I did in the [raytracing.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeroXP/Roblox-stugg/main/RayTracing/raytrace.lua) file i've given it makes a whole bunch of blocks/cube and then puts them into a cube shape ehich follows around the character.
